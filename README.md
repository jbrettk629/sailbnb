  Given that this project was built in two weeks, some features had to be skipped over when they couldn't be completed quickly. In the future, I will revisit this project and add the following features

  * Rental Search - users will be able to search for boats to stay on   based on the number of guests, location, or timespan
  * Map Search - the index page of boats will filter based on the bounds of the map. Users will be able to use the map to identify places to stay
